# Spread Sheet
A spreadsheet application developed as part of the CS 3500 course.
This project demonstrates proficiency in handling cell dependencies, formula evaluation, error management, 
and GUI creation while emphasizing thorough testing and code coverage.

## About Spreadsheet
This project involved creating a functional spreadsheet application with the following key features:
- Cell Dependencies: Automatically updates dependent cells when changes are made.
- Formula Handling: Supports valid formulas while detecting and managing incorrect or circular references.
- Error Management: Ensures invalid formulas or input errors are identified and handled gracefully.
- GUI Integration: Implements a user-friendly graphical interface for intuitive interaction with the spreadsheet.
- Testing: Achieved 100% code coverage through rigorous unit tests to ensure the reliability of each class and method.

## Key Features
Dynamic Updates: Cells update dynamically based on dependencies.
Formula Evaluation: Processes mathematical expressions with variables seamlessly.
Error Reporting: Provides clear feedback for invalid operations or inputs.
Testing: Comprehensive testing ensures all edge cases are covered.
